### Hello there!  I'm Stephen Perry.

I'm a student at Codeup studying Data Science.  I'll be learning Python, SQL and other tools and how to use them in the data science pipeline.  I'll also learn how to apply concepts and formulas in statistics to analyze data sets and deduce valuable information from them to aid stakeholders in making critical business decisions.
